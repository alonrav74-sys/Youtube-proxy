## 🆕 Phase 4: HMM/Viterbi Algorithm (+5-10%)

### What is HMM/Viterbi?

**Hidden Markov Model:**
- Models chord transitions as probabilities
- Some transitions are common (C→F, C→G)
- Others are rare (C→F#, C→Gb)
- Enforces musical logic

**Viterbi Algorithm:**
- Finds most likely chord sequence
- Given: observations + transition probabilities
- Returns: optimal path through chord space
- Corrects low-confidence chords

### Implementation:

```javascript
1. Transition Matrix (12×12):
   - Self: 30% (stay on same chord)
   - Down 5th (V→I): 25% (perfect cadence)
   - Down 4th (IV→I): 18% (plagal)
   - Up 2nd: 12% (ii→V)
   - Down 3rd: 8% (vi→IV)
   - Chromatic: 0.5% (rare)

2. Viterbi Decoder:
   - Forward pass with log probabilities
   - Backtrack to find best path
   - Correct chords with confidence < 70%

3. Integration:
   - Runs after temporal smoothing
   - Before beat quantization
   - Only in Accurate mode
```

### Benefits:

- ✅ Removes impossible progressions (C→F#dim)
- ✅ Smooths detection errors
- ✅ Enforces Circle of Fifths logic
- ✅ +5-10% accuracy improvement

### Code Location:
- `chord-engine-pro.js` lines 1310-1480
- Functions: `buildTransitionMatrix()`, `viterbiSmoothing()`, `getEmissionProb()`
